## Description: 
This README generator is a command line tool that will allow the user to generate a quality README.md file from the command line.

This will prompt a series of questions to populate in your command line.  Answer these questions.  After the questions have been answered you will get a message that reads "The file has been saved."  At this point there well be a quality README file in your dist folder titled "README.md".  Congratulations!You have created your first quality README.md file using the command line.
