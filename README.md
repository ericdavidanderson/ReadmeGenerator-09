## Description: 
This README generator is a command line tool that will allow the user to generate a quality README.md file from the command line.  

## Installation:
Once you have your command line open from this root file, simply install the npm dependencies with 'npm i' command, after the npm dependencies load, enter 'node index.js'in your command line. This will prompt a series of questions to populate in your command line. Answer these questions. After the questions have been answered you will get a message that reads "The file has been saved." At this point there well be a quality README file in your dist folder titled "README.md". Congratulations!You have created your first quality README.md file using the command line.
